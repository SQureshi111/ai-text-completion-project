# AI Text Completion Projec

This project is a hands-on exploration of Generative AI, where we built a Python-based application that sends prompts to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model and receives coherent, creative, and relevant text completions.

## Objectives
- Understand how large language models generate human-like text.
- Design effective prompts and evaluate AI responses.
- Experiment with creativity controls like `temperature` and `max_tokens`.
- Reflect on the strengths and limitations of current Generative AI models.

## How It Works
- Users type a prompt (e.g., “Explain photosynthesis to a 10-year-old”).
- The prompt is sent via OpenAI’s API to `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- The AI’s completion is displayed in real-time.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo or open the Colab notebook.
2. Install dependencies:# ai-text-completion-project
